For all tests: time step is 0.001, time unit for all time is second



For only 1 time step:

			detection method:	elapsed time:
number of balls: 100	     naive		   0.018
			   accelerated		   0.006

number of balls: 1000	     naive		   1.774
			   accelerated		   0.062

number of balls: 10000	     naive		   162.881
			   accelerated		   0.657



For 30 time steps:

			detection method:	elapsed time:
number of balls: 100	     naive		   0.486
			   accelerated		   0.154

number of balls: 1000	     naive		   45.451
			   accelerated		   1.637

number of balls: 10000	no result cause no one wants to want half an hour or maybe longer
